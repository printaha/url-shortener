# url-shortener
Description: URL shortening service (django)

This project was coded using Python 3.4 and Django 1.7. To try the service on your own you need to install Python and Django and use the manage.py runserver command. After that you can use the service with your browser with the address and port 127.0.0.1:8000 (localhost:8000)... At your own risk, of course!
